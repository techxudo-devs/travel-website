If you’re here, it’s probably because deep down, you’re ready to take that leap. You’ve been dreaming of that solo adventure, craving new experiences, freedom, and growth, but maybe you're still looking for that little push or someone to reassure you that you’ve got this.

Ready? Let's do this together! 🌍✨

Independence and Growth:
Solo travel is one of the best ways to discover how independent and strong you truly are. When you’re out there on your own, every decision, from what to eat to how to explore a new city is entirely up to you.
It’s not about being forced to figure things out. It’s about realizing that you can.

Building Confidence & Breaking Limiting Beliefs:
Solo travel gives you confidence like nothing else. For me, it was about breaking free from all the limiting beliefs I had carried for so long. I used to think people would judge me if I went out alone. I found a confidence in myself I never thought existed. Now I feel strong, confident, outgoing, and empowered. Something I never imagined I could feel about myself before my first solo trip.
“Confidence isn’t about being fearless. it’s about taking that first step, even when you’re scared.”

Connection & Human Interaction:
One of the biggest myths about solo travel is that you’ll feel lonely. But in my experience, it’s often the complete opposite. When you travel alone, something inside you opens up. You become more approachable, more curious, more present. And that energy? People feel it.

Overcoming Challenges & Loneliness:
Of course, solo travel isn’t always easy.
There will be moments when things go wrong. A missed flight, a language barrier, or that unexpected wave of omesickness. These are the parts that don’t get talked about as much, but they’re part of the journey too. And the key is learning how to face those moments with grace and a little patience. Solo travel doesn’t mean everything will be  perfect. But it does give you space to grow through the challenges. To listen to yourself more deeply. To comfort yourself. To become your own safe place. And every time you make it through one of those low moments, you come out stronger. You build emotional resilience. You learn that you can handle things and that joy always finds its way back in.

Joys of Freedom:
There’s a kind of freedom you only truly understand once you’ve traveled solo. It’s not just about being alone. It’s about doing exactly what you want, when you want, a loving that feeling.

Lessons Learned:
Waiting around for the right moment or the right company can mean missing out on experiences that might change you forever. Through all the places I’ve explored, the people I’ve met, and the quiet moments I’ve spent with myself, solo travel has taught me that I am so much stronger, braver, and more capable than I ever gave myself credit for.

A Message to the Girl Who’s Waiting for a Sign:
I truly believe that everyone should experience solo travel at least once in her life. Not just to see the world, but to discover who you really are when no one else is around to tell her who to be. And trust me, we all think we know, but if you never traveled solo. I can assure you, you don´t know yet.

If you’ve been waiting for the perfect time, or for someone to join you…
If you’ve been thinking about it but keep holding yourself back…
If you've been hoping for a little push or a sign to finally go for it.
This is it.
You’re ready.
Even if you're scared.
Even if you’re still doubting yourself.
Even if the only thing you know is that you want more.
Take the leap.
Because on the other side of that fear… is the strongest, most alive version of you.
And I promise, she’s worth meeting. 💖

Don’t overthink it. Sometimes the best way to start is to book the ticket and trust that you’ll figure out the rest!

Chapter 1: Choosing Your Destination
Familiarity vs. Adventure: If it’s your first trip, choose a place where you feel safe, like I did with Aruba. Familiar destinations can ease anxiety and build confidence. Or, consider a destination closer to home—even just an hour’s drive away—so you still feel comfortable while enjoying a new environment. For those feeling adventurous, explore destinations known for solo travelers, like Lisbon, Bali, or Mexico City.

Safety First: Research crime rates, cultural norms, and solo female traveler experiences. If you’re part of the Travel Girls community, post in the group to ask for recommendations, or feel free to reach out to me directly—I’d be happy to
help! You can also check websites like Nomad List and travel forums for detailed insights.

Interests: Look for destinations that align with what you love. Are you drawn to beaches, mountains, or foodie hotspots? Your first solo trip should excite and inspire you.

Chapter 2: Budgeting Without Stress
1) Set Your Overall Budget: Decide how much you’re comfortablespending on flights, accommodations, food, activities, and
unexpected expenses.
2) Track Costs: Use apps like Trail Wallet or Google Sheets to stay ontop of your spending.
3) Be Flexible: Search for flight deals on Skyscanner or GoogleFlights, and consider traveling during off-peak seasons for lower costs.
4) Save Smart: Start a travel fund by cutting small expenses and redirecting those savings toward your trip.

Chapter 3: Booking accommodations that work for you
1) Hostels: Great for meeting people and saving money. I would recommend you to filter for hostels rated 8+ for cleanliness and safety, but a 7+ rating could also work.
2) Hotels and Airbnb: Perfect for a bit more privacy and comfort. Choose centrally located options to save on  ransportation costs. If you stay further out, research transport options and costs in advance to ensure it’s still practical.
3) Female-Only Options: Many hostels and co-living spaces cater specifically to women, providing added security and comfort.

Chapter 4: Planning Activities Without Overloading
1) Research Must-See Spots: Focus on activities that genuinely excite you rather than just checking off tourist hotspots.
2) Leave Room for Discovery: Talk to locals—they often know about hidden gems that are even more beautiful than well-known attractions.
3) Solo-Friendly Activities: Join group tours, cooking classes, or workshops to meet people while learning something new. You can also explore unique experiences through Airbnb or ask your hostel/hotel for recommendations.

Chapter 5: Preparing for the Unexpected
1) Pack Smart: Make a checklist of essentials like a power bank, universal adapter, and travel insurance.
2) Stay Connected: Share your itinerary with a trusted friend or family member, and keep them updated as you travel. You can always use apps to share your live location.
3) Trust Yourself: Your intuition is your best guide. If something doesn’t feel right, it’s okay to say no, change plans, or walk away.

Conclusion: You’ve Got This!
Solo travel might feel overwhelming at first, but once you take the leap, it can change your life in the most amazing ways. I’ll never forget how scared I was before my first trip, but the friendships I made and the confidence I gained have stayed with me ever since. ✨

Hey lovely travelers! 💖 If you’re reading this, it’s because you’re probably planning a trip to London and the English
countryside, and I have to tell you, you are going to absolutely LOVE IT! London is pure magic, with so many things to do, incredible places to explore, and let’s not forget, it’s a dream for foodies like me! 😋 But the countryside? Oh, it’s straight out of a fairytale.

1) Day One: Classic London Sights:
Start your day at London Bridge 🏰, and of course, visit the Tower of London. Plan to spend 2-3 hours here exploring the Crown Jewels and soaking up the fascinating history of this iconic place. After that, cross the bridge to the Borough Market 🌮. This foodie haven is packed with stalls offering everything from fresh pastries to global street food. I couldn’t resist the Thai stall when I visited, and it was super tasty!
Once you’re fueled up, take a riverside walk towards the London Eye 🌊. It’s such a beautiful route, and there are plenty of picture-worthy spots along the way, so keep your camera close!😉 

2) Day Two: Markets, Parks, and Little Venice:
Today is all about exploring unique neighborhoods and finding those peaceful little escapes that make London so special. 💕 Start your morning at Camden Market 🛍️. This place truly has it all—quirky boutiques, vintage treasures, and the kind of street food that makes you want to try a little bit of everything. You have to grab lunch here because the options are endless (and sooo good!).
Next, start walking towards Primrose Hill 🌳. It’s a short walk, and when you get to the top, the view of London’s skyline will take your breath away. It’s the kind of spot that makes you want to pause and just soak it all in.
From there, head down to Regent’s Park 🌸. The gardens are stunning. It’s such a peaceful escape! Take your time, wander, and enjoy.

3) Day Three: Notting Hill, Kensington, and Shopping:
Ready for some color and culture? I will take you into one of
London’s most charming areas! 💕
Start your day at the Victoria and Albert Museum 🎨 in South Kensington. It’s free to visit and filled with stunning art and design collections. You’ll find everything from fashion to photography here, and it’s the perfect way to start your day.
Next, make your way to Notting Hill 🏘️ and the famous Portobello Road Market 🛍️. This area feels like something out of
a storybook. Pastel-colored houses, unique market stalls, and such a vibe! Trust me, you’ll want to have your camera ready because the photo opportunities here are endless.
For lunch, stop at Farm Girl Cafe 🍽️ in Notting Hill. Their fresh, healthy dishes are as delicious as they are Instagram-worthy. It’s trendy, colorful, and the perfect spot to refuel before the afternoon.
After lunch, take walk through Kensington Gardens 🌳. The gardens are so peaceful and beautiful, and they lead you right to Kensington Palace, where you can take in a bit of royal history.
End the day with a Thames River Cruise 🚤. Seeing the city from the water as the sun sets? It’s magical and the perfect way to wrap up the day.

4) Day Four: Windsor Castle, Blenheim Palace, and the Cotswolds:
In my case, I was lucky enough to do this trip with a local friend, which made getting to all these spots super easy. But don’t worry. If you don’t have someone to join you on this mini road trip, I’ve got your back! I’ll share the links at the end of this post so you can explore all these dreamy towns without having to drive 😉

5) Day Five: Castle Combe, Lacock, and Bath:
Start your morning heading to Castle Combe 🌸. It’s tiny but absolutely worth the visit. The peaceful atmosphere, cute church, and picturesque little homes will make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time. Take a short walk through the quiet streets and soak it all in.
Next, it’s a short drive to Lacock 🏡, a medieval village that’s straight out of a storybook (yes, it´s known as a Harry Potter filming location). Spend about an hour exploring the cobblestone streets and visiting Lacock Abbey..
From Lacock, make your way to Bath 🛁 (just 30 minutes away). This city is packed with history and elegance. Spend your
afternoon exploring the Roman Baths, the beautiful Bath Abbey, and the iconic Royal Crescent.

6) Day Six: Stonehenge and Return to London:
We’re wrapping up the trip with two iconic spots that are absolute must-sees.
Start your morning at Stonehenge 🏛️ (about an hour from Bath). This prehistoric site is full of mystery and history. Spend 1-2 hours exploring the ancient stones and checking out the visitor center. I had a quick bite there but the food is not so good lol 🙈
Next, drive to Oxford 🎓 (about 1.5 hours). This university town is stunning, and there’s so much to see. Wander around for 2-3 hours, visit the Radcliffe Camera, stroll through the Bodleian Library, and if you’re a Harry Potter fan, don’t miss Christ Church College. It’s magical and makes you feel like you’re stepping right into Hogwarts!
After Oxford, it’s time to head back to London 🚗 (about 1.5-2 hours). Once you’re back, treat yourself to a cozy dinner and take a moment to reflect on all the incredible memories from this trip. And hey, maybe start editing some of your photos to start posting. They’re going to look amazing! 😉

The perfect 3 day itinerary:
If you’re traveling from the USA, you’ll most likely connect through a major European hub like London, Dublin, Frankfurt, or Amsterdam before landing in Split. Direct flights are rare, but seasonal routes sometimes pop up during peak travel times. For those already in Europe, Split is a breeze to reach. Airlines like Croatia Airlines, Ryanair, Vueling and EasyJet offer direct flights from cities like Paris, Rome, Berlin, Barcelona and London.

1) Day 1: Exploring the old town:
The best way to start your time in Split is with a walking tour to get a feel for the layout and history of the city. Free walking tours are fantastic here, and while there’s no charge upfront, it’s customary to leave a tip. Most people give between €10 and €20 per person.

• Climb St. Domnius Cathedral’s Bell Tower:
For panoramic views of Split, head up the bell tower. On a clear day, the view is absolutely worth the climb. Tickets for the bell tower alone cost up to 10€ because you can get combo tickets if you want to explore the crypt and other areas too. Buy your tickets at the base of the tower and get ready for a breathtaking experience.

• Take a Stroll Down the Riva Promenade:
No trip to Split is complete without a walk along the Riva promenade. Stretching along the seafront, the Riva is lined with charming pink flowers, iconic palm trees, and vibrant market stalls. Some stalls are a bit touristy, but they’re fun to browse. I found some cute little trinkets and souvenirs that weren’t too tacky.

• Wander Through Trg Republike (Republic Square):
From there you can continue walking for another bit and explore the colorful and elaborate buildings of Republic Square, also known as Prokurative. This spot often hosts cultural events, but even when quiet, it buzzes with the lively atmosphere of bars and restaurants. Pro tip: While it’s lovely to enjoy a drink here, skip the main square eateries. They’re touristy and overpriced. Instead, sip your drink, people-watch, and bask in the little streets nearby.

• Rub the Toe of Grgur Ninski for Luck:
No visit to Split is complete without paying a visit to the towering statue of Grgur Ninski (Gregory of Nin). Legend has it that rubbing his shiny bronze toe brings good luck. The statue, crafted by sculptor Ivan Meštrović, immortalizes the bishop who famously promoted the use of the Croatian language in church services. Whether or not you believe in the luck, it’s a fun and quirky Split tradition to partake in.

• Climb Marjan Hill for Breathtaking Views:
Save some energy for Marjan Hill, a must-visit for stunning views of Split. Start your ascent from the Riva, making your way to the Teraca Vidilica bar for your first photo op. From here, follow the path to discover more scenic viewpoints as you climb.

• Dine in Style at Restoran Perivoj:
Wrap up your day with a magical meal at Restoran Perivoj, one of Split’s most beautiful dining spots. Set in an Art Nouveau villa, the restaurant boasts an enchanting Mediterranean garden adorned with bougainvillaea and fairy lights. The central fountain adds an extra touch of romance. The food here is as memorable as the setting. I splurged on the Seabass for 30€, and it was worth every bite.

2) Day 2: A Blend of Local Charm, Nature, and Culinary Delights:
Start your day like a local by heading to Pazar, Split’s open-air market. Located just outside the eastern wall of the palace, this vibrant market is a sensory delight. As the sun rises, locals and café owners bustle about, filling their baskets with fresh fruit, vegetables, and other local goodies.

• Discover Croatian Art at the Museum of Fine Arts:
If you’re an art lover—or just curious about Croatian creativity—the Museum of Fine Arts is a must. Located in a beautifully restored old hospital (possibly haunted, but let’s keep it light), the museum is home to a collection of works from the 14th century to modern-day.
One of my favorite discoveries here was Emanuel Vidović, a Split-born artist whose works capture the essence of Dalmatian life. Keep an eye out for the quirky tower of teapots near the staircase—a delight for any tea enthusiast.
Entry is just €5, and the museum offers a cool, serene break from the summer heat.

• OR hike to a tasty meal:
IIf hiking is something you love as much as I do, why not turn it into a journey to your lunch spot? 🌿 Head to Familija Restaurant, a charming local spot known for its tasty food. The route offers a relaxed and easy walk alongside a small river that eventually flows into the sea—perfect for soaking in the serene vibes before your meal.

• treat yourself with an Ice Cream at Hajduk:
No day in Split is complete without indulging in some gelato. I’ve done the hard work of trying (a lot of) ice cream spots in Split, and here are my top picks:
1) Ela’s Icecream & More: Incredible vegan options, especially the rich and creamy chocolate.
2) Sladoledarnica Hajduk: A favorite among locals, with generous scoops starting at just €1.
3) Sladoledarnica Emiliana: Known for its unique flavors like lavender and lemon or ricotta and fig.
Pick your spot, grab a scoop (or two), and enjoy the sweet, cooling treat as you wander the streets of Split.

• Evening: Savor Local Flavors in an Authentic Tavern:
Wrap up your day by indulging in the best of Split’s local cuisine at a cozy, traditional tavern: Nevera Tavern. For a truly authentic experience, try their house specialty: homemade pasta with seafood. Every bite is a celebration of fresh, local ingredients and Dalmatian culinary heritage.

3) Day 3: Beach Day + Sunset Magic, Island Hopping, or Krka National Park:
• Option 1: enjoy the beach and a beautiful sunset:
If relaxing by the water is your vibe, Split offers several beach options. If it´s your 1st time in Europe I have to tell you that many beaches are rocky, not sandy, so make sure to pack water shoes like these ones. They are not cute nor sexy, but you wil thank me later.

• Option 2: Day Trip to Krka National Park:
If you’re craving nature, spend your day exploring Krka National Park. Just a 1.5-hour drive from Split, this stunning park is famous for its cascading waterfalls and lush greenery.

• Option 3: Island Hopping or Hvar Adventure:
For those eager to explore beyond the mainland, Split’s location makes it an ideal base for island-hopping or a visit to Hvar. Island Hopping Tours.
Hop aboard a boat and discover Croatia’s breathtaking islands. Most tours include stops at stunning spots like the Blue Cave, Green Cave, and Vis Island. Expect crystal-clear waters, secret coves, and plenty of opportunities to swim and snorkel. Visit Hvar.

Final Thoughts:
I hope these tips help you make the most of your time in Split! 🌟

Making friends while traveling solo is easier than you think. Tips and tricks for socializing, joining activities, and meeting like-minded travelers.

• Start Before You Leave:
You don’t have to wait until you land to start meeting people. Just putting yourself out there a little before the trip can make a big difference and it means you might already have someone to message, to get coffee with, or to explore a new place together the moment you arrive. And honestly, that tiny bit of connection can make the whole experience feel way less overwhelming, especially if it’s your first solo trip.

Hi girl, if you’re planning your first solo trip, or if you’ve already been on one and came back wondering was I supposed to talk to someone at some point? I totally get it.
I still remember planning my very first solo trip. It was exciting and terrifying at the same time. I had so many questions running through my head, especially around this whole "meeting people" thing. Would I feel lonely? Would it be awkward? Would I spend the whole time just talking to myself?
That trip was years ago, and since then, I’ve traveled a lot on my own. And I’ve never stayed in a hostel. Not because I have anything against them, they’re just not for me. So I had to figure out other ways to meet people, and I promise you, there are plenty.
That’s actually why I made this guide. I wanted to put everything I’ve learned in one place, so if you're sitting there with a million questions.
This isn’t one of those “just join a pub crawl and you'll make friends instantly” kind of guides. This is real, personal, and hopefully helpful. If you’re a little shy, super social, or somewhere in between, these are ways that have worked for me and for many other girls I’ve met along the way.

Let’s walk through it together.

• Ways to Connect Before Your Trip:
Once you're on the road, the key is putting yourself in social situations. You don’t have to wait for someone to talk to you. You just have to stay open, the rest will come naturally.
And I get it, this can feel like a lot at first. Trust me, I’ve been there. Before I started traveling solo, even doing simple things alone felt intimidating. I used to worry people would judge me, or think I had no friends, or wonder why I was alone. But here’s the thing, those fears? They only exist in our heads.
The truth is, No one is really paying much attention. People are usually in their own little world, just like you. Let’s be real, when was the last time you paid close attention to what a stranger was doing at a café or on the street? Unless they were, I don’t know, dancing in a chicken costume, you probably didn’t even notice them. And funnily enough, a lot of people around you are actually hoping for connection too. They’re just waiting for someone to go first.
So, keep that in mind. The first time you push yourself out of your comfort zone? It’s tough. The second time? A little less. And then suddenly, it just becomes part of who you are. Not just in the way you meet people while traveling, but in the way you see yourself. It’s one of those small shifts that ends up transforming so much more than just your social life.

• How to Start Conversations (Without It Feeling Awkward):
Starting a conversation with someone you don’t know can feel a little nerve-wracking. But it really doesn’t have to be. Most people are way more open than you think, especially when they’re traveling.

Here are a few easy ways I break the ice:
👋 Just say hi: Yep, really. A simple “Hey, where are you from?” works almost every time. Travelers love talking about where they’ve been and where they’re going.

🌍 Find something in common: If someone’s holding a camera, ask what they’re shooting. If they’re reading a book, ask what it’s about. Small things lead to easy conversations. You don’t need a perfect opening line, just curiosity.
🫶 Give a real compliment: “I love your bag, where did you get it?” That’s it. Compliments are sweet and effortless, and most people open right up when they feel seen.

🤣 Use Humor: Travel gives you plenty of awkward or funny moments. Laugh about getting lost or struggling with a foreign menu. It instantly makes you relatable!

🍽️ Invite someone to join you: If you’re sitting in a café or heading to grab a bite, and there’s someone nearby who seems open, just ask, “Hey, want to join me?” The worst thing that can happen is they say no. But most of the time, people are grateful you went first.

✨ My personal favorite? The ‘come talk to me’ look Lol: It’s that soft, friendly glance, just enough eye contact to say “I’m open to chatting,” without being flirty. Believe it or not, this works every time. People usually smile back. And then it’s easy to follow with a “Hi, are you traveling solo too?” or “Do you live here?”
Sometimes they’ll even come up to you first and say, “Hey, I saw you sitting here alone, where are you from?”

 Because honestly, so many people want to connect, but they don’t always know how to make the first move. And once you realize that, it all feels so much easier.

• Final Thoughts: You got this!
Meeting people while traveling doesn’t have to be scary. It can actually become one of the best and most meaningful parts of your trip.

✨ You don’t need to stay in a hostel to meet amazing people.
✨ Putting yourself out there, even just a little, makes all the difference.
✨ Most travelers are friendly and just as open to connection as you are.

If you’re feeling a little nervous, that’s completely okay. I felt the same before my first solo trip. But I promise, it gets easier. And each time you push yourself just a little bit, it opens the door to something beautiful.

So go for it. Book the trip. Say yes to the group tour. Smile at the girl sitting next to you. Start the conversation.
